        <h2>Intro to Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Intro to Programming course! This course is for you if
          you have never written a single line of code, and you are interested
          in learning data science and machine learning. (If you do have
          programming experience and are just new to the Python language, the
          <a href="">Python course</a> is a better fit to get started.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In this course, you will learn how to use code to get a computer to
          perform certain tasks for you. Python is one of the most popular
          programming languages for data science, and it's the language you'll
          learn in this course. Once you complete this course, you'll be fully
          prepared to progress to the <a href="">Python course</a>, followed by
          the <a href="">Intro to Machine Learning course</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this tutorial, you'll see several examples of Python code. You'll
          get a chance to write your own code in the exercise. (If you'd like to
          preview the exercise, feel free to <a href=""> take a look now</a>. We
          also provide a link to the exercise at the end of this tutorial.)

        <h2>Printing</h2>
        <p>
          Printing One of the simplest (and most important!) tasks you can ask a
          computer to do is to print a message.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Python, we ask a computer to print a message for us by writing
          print() and putting the message inside the parentheses and enclosed in
          quotation marks. Below, we ask the computer to print the message
          Hello, world!.
        </p>
        <div class="coding-box-si">
          <p>
            <span class="function-si">print</span>(<span class="string-si"
              >"Hello, world!"</span
            >)

        </div>
        <p class="hello-world-answer-p-si answer-p-si">Hello, world!</p>
        <p class="the-code-is-p-si after-answer-p-si">
          The code is inside the box (known as a code cell), and the computer's
          response (called the output of the code) is shown below the box. As
          you can see, the computer printed the message that we wanted.

      <div class="arithmetic-si">
        <h2>Arithmetic</h2>
        <p>
          We can also print the value of some arithmetic operation (such as
          addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in the next code cell, the computer adds 2 to 1 and then
          prints the result, which is 3. Note that unlike when we were simply
          printing text, we don't use any quotation marks.

      <div class="comments-si">
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
          We use <b>comments</b> to annotate what code is doing. They help other
          people to understand your code, and they can also be helpful if you
          haven't looked at your own code in a while. So far, the code that we
          have written is very short, but annotations become more important when
          you have written a lot of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in the next code cell, we multiply 3 by 2. We also add a
          comment (# Multiply 3 by 2) above the code to describe what the code
          is doing.
        </p>
        <div class="coding-box-si">
          <p><span class="comment-si"># Multiply 3 by 2</span></p>
          <p>
            <span class="function-si">print</span>(3
            <span class="operator-si">*</span> 2)
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="answer-6p-si answer-p-si">6</p>
        <p class="to-indicate-to-p-si after-answer-p-si">
          To indicate to Python that a line is comment (and not Python code),
          you need to write a pound sign (#) as the very first character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once Python sees the pound sign and recognizes that the line is a
          comment, it is completely ignored by the computer. This is important,
          because just like English or Hindi (or any other language!), Python is
          a language with very strict rules that need to be followed. Python is
          stricter than a human listener, though, and will just error if it
          can't understand the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see an example of this, in the code cell below. Python errors
          if we remove the pound sign, because the text in the comment is not
          valid Python code, so it can't be interpreted properly.

          In general, to work with a variable, you need to begin by selecting
          the name you want to use. Variable names are ideally short and
          descriptive. They also need to satisfy several requirements:
        </p>
        <div class="unordered-list-si">
          <ul>
            <li>They can't have spaces (e.g., test var is not allowed)</li>

              They can only include letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g.,
              test_var! is not allowed)
            </li>
            <li>
              They have to start with a letter or underscore (e.g., 1_var is not
              allowed)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Then, to create the variable, you need to use = to assign the value
          that you want it to have.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can always take a look at the value assigned to the variable by
          using print() and putting the name of the variable in parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, you'll learn how to select good names for Python variables.
          It's completely fine for it to feel uncomfortable now, and the best
          way to learn is just by viewing a lot of Python code!

          60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 4, but it is much harder to check that the
          calculation without variables does not have some error, because it is
          not as readable. When we use variables (such as num_years,
          days_per_year, etc), we can better keep track of each part of the
          calculation and more easily check for and correct any mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it is particularly useful to use variables when the values
          of the inputs can change. For instance, say we want to slightly
          improve our estimate by updating the value of the number of days in a
          year from 365 to 365.25, to account for leap years. Then we can change
          the value assigned to days_per_year without changing any of the other
          variables and redo the calculation.

          <b>Note</b>: You might have noticed the .0 added at the end of the
          number, which might look unnecessary. This is caused by the fact that
          in the second calculation, we used a number with a fractional part
          (365.25), whereas the first calculation multipled just numbers with no
          fractional part. You'll learn more about this in Lesson 3, when we
          cover data types.

          One common error when working with variables is to accidentally
          introduce typos. For instance, if we spell hours_per_day as
          hours_per_dy, Python will error with message NameError: name
          'hours_per_dy' is not defined.

          When you see NameError like this, it's an indication that you should
          check how you have spelled the variable that it references as "not
          defined". Then, to fix the error, you need only correct the spelling.
